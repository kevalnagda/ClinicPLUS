# Welcome to Healthcare.ai!

The aim of **healthcareai** is to streamline machine learning in healthcare with two main goals:

- Allow one to easily create models based on tabular data, and deploy a good model that pushes predictions to a database (MSSQL, MySQL, SQLite, CSV).
- Provide tools related to data cleaning, manipulation, and imputation.

## Where's the Source Code?

## Do I Want This Package or the [R package](https://docs.healthcare.ai)?

Choose this Python package if several of the following apply:

- You love Python
- You're working with 5M+ rows
- You can tolerate some quirks

Otherwise, the [R package](https://docs.healthcare.ai) is recommended, as it currently has more features and R is tends to be more newbie-friendly. R is where we're putting most of our time.

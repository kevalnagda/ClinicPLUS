# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who Is This Project For?

While data scientists in healthcare will likely find this project
valuable, the target audience for healthcare.ai are those BI developers,
data architects, and SQL developers that would love to create
appropriate and accurate models with healthcare data. While existing
machine learning packages are certainly irreplaceable, we think that
there is a set of data problems specific to healthcare that warrant new
tools.

## How Does Healthcare.ai Focus On Healthcare?

healthcare.ai differs from other machine learning packages in that it
focuses on data issues specific to healthcare. This means that we pay
attention to longitudinal questions, offer an easy way to do
risk-adjusted comparisons, and provide easy connections and deployment
to databases.

## Who Started This Project?

This project began in the data science group at Health Catalyst, a Salt
Lake City-based company focused on improving healthcare outcomes.

## Why Was It Open-sourced?

We believe that everyone benefits when healthcare is made more efficient
and outcomes are improved. Machine learning is surprisingly still fairly
new to healthcare and we want to quickly take healthcare down the
machine learning adoption path. We believe that making helpful, simple
tools widely available is one small way to help healthcare organizations
transform their data into actionable insight that can be used to improve
outcomes.

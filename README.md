# ClinicPlus
## A solution need not be disruptive to be contributive.
Data and analytics will drive modern business operations, and not simply reflect their performance.

By using clinic analytics, doctors, businesses and researchers can analyze valuable big data to improve their strategy and improve workflow, thus stimulating growth. Through data-driven decision making, healthcare facilities will be able to “improve operational efficiencies, eliminate preventable costs, and streamline clinical effectiveness

## Major issues in the industry & the current solutions

### • Lack of incentives for business owners to invest in the application
Current solutions tend to be either using ML/DL approaches for an extremely edge case scenario which might not be necessarily applicable to the majority of the population or they are too customer centric lacking any vision for the actual buyer of the product - the clinic

### • Lack of easy to use Business Intelligence for the clinics
Most clinics do not have a seperate developer team, who can focus on their business intelligence aspects and design data accordingly. Hence the system they use must provide an intuitive interface, which allows ease of operability.

### • Data being wasted
A recent survey shows that 40% of clinical analytics users concluded that their data was either not very effective or was completely ineffective

## How Clinic+ solves these issues

### • Provide meaningful data
We only record data which is needed and use all the data recorded data in some form or other - optimizing storage space and operability

### • Business Intelligence simplified
We provide dashboards, pre configured for most use cases - for any custom use cases, making new dashboards is a breeze and is as simple as making them using natural language.

### • Reporting Efficiency
Reports can be given out to the patient as soon as they are generated. The need for someone to review them first and then hand out the reports after a couple of hours is eliminated from the equation. 

### • Incentives, for practically everyone in the eco system
Clinics are incentivized by saving money as they no longer need to hire someone to specifically review the reports which would any get reviewed again by the consulting doctor who ordered them to begin with

Customers get a centralized storage for all their reports, making them come back to the same lab again in order to keep their reports consolidated. 

Doctors benifit by getting the reports immediately, and depending upon the clinic, the doctors can be incentivized by the number of tests conducted under their name.

### • Reducing adverse events
Some reports being sensitive in nature need to be handed out immediately

### • Ease of use for everyone involved
